##  About

I'm Charo Nuguid, and I'm an independent Technology Consultant and Trainer.

## Hardware

I use a rather old 2011 NEO B5700 laptop. It's has an Intel i7 (Sandy Bridge) processor with 4GB RAM. I use a standing desk setup making use of laptop risers similar to the one below:

I also own a Raspberry Pi 2 which I use as my mobile workstation, powered by a powerbank. I use my Xiaomi Mi3 phone as a hotspot for the RPi and Nexus 7 (1/gen) tablet. Then using the tablet I virturally connect to the RPi and start working. I'll post details of the setup on my blog soon.

When my laptop can't handle the building of some of my docker containers, I ssh into an AWS EC2 instance.

I also have two external desktop hard drives.

## Software

* Sublime Text/vim for text editing
* Git for version control
* Github for open source projects
* Bitbucket for open source and private projects, as well as personal journal and to-do list
* Chrome for work

* Google Drive, DropBox, and AWS S3 for cloud storage
* AWS S3 for my blog
* KeeperSecurity
* Gmail for email
* Diigo for bookmarking
* Namecheap
* Steam for gaming

## Dream Setup

My dream setup changes every year. For now, I'd like to upgrade my laptop. Like a Dell XPS 13 or a Razor Blade Stealth. I'm leaning towards the latter so I can hook up a Razon Core and finally get back to some much needed gaming. I wouldn't mind building my own from a barebones laptop like Clevo. My current laptop happens to be built from a Clevo as well.

## Others

2017-03-0 : I'm studying BioInformatics and Computational Neurscience on Coursera to see which of the two I'd like to pursue as a masters (leading to PhD) in the next two years.
